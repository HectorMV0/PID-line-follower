# PID-line-follower
In this project, we used Matlab to implement a PID controller, together with Coppelia Sim, where we were able to generate paths of different difficulties and add a line follower robot with 3 optic sensors in which to test our PID.

# What I did
1. I was responsible for the coding of the PID in Matlab, as well as the tuning of the constants for the correct performance of the robot.
2. I collaborated with my teammates to create the different paths and stablish the communication between Matlab and Coppelia Sim for the simulation to receive the PID results for the speed of each motor.
